  <summary><ins>About Me</ins></summary>

  <div align="center">
    <p>Hello, my name is Evaen and i'm 18 years old, the birthday being on the 20th of November.</p>
    <p>Nicknames: Bear, Ev, Blue Guy, Beast</p>
    <p>British Gypsy, Czech, Hungarian, Russian | English & Czech speaker.</p>
    <p>A proud selfshipper of Twilight Sparkle with my fictional sonas; i'm aromantic and straight.<p>
    <p>I'm a semi-verbal E/INFJ 8w9, in case a person like this doesn't suit your taste.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p>I am blind in my left eye and have Level Two Autism.</p>
    <p>Side note: hyperfixated on all shades of blue and is a big part of me. 💙</p>

  <summary><ins>Pony Town</ins></summary>

  <div align="center">
    <p>I love cuddles, piles, do whatever you want even if I'm with people, shoutout to my cuddlers — just don't do anything that'll irritate me on purpose, and try not to cover my Beast cosplay for prolonged periods of time.</p>
    <p>I enjoy hangouts and crowds.<p>
    <p>(EXCLUDING MY BEAST COSPLAY) Covering me is fine by friends or if it's for cuddle purposes by strangers.<p>
    <p>Whisper to interact, there's a small chance i might see your public message.</p>
    <p>I adore waking up to whispers, you are open to send any, spam is ok because of the new tabs.</p>
    <p>Don't expect a response out of me all the time, but i will respond if i want to.<p>
    <p>Away From Keyboard/Off-tab a lot of the time, this doesn't mean always, as i could be talking to friends in party/whispers or making a skin — sleep emote doesn't always mean i'm busy.<p>
    <p>I'd appreciate if you don't ask to rolepay with me or even think i will.<p>
    <p>Don't always assume i'll give you attention for wearing a Belle skin if i don't know you.<p>
    <p>I ignore all advertisements in my whispers, especially ones begging for assistance with their build limit, i'm not the guy for this.<p>
    <p>Copying me and/or my friends, with the knowledge of this action being strongly looked down upon without consent, is an awful action to do, refrain from doing this.</p>

    <p>Realist, Open-minded, straightforward.<p>
    <p>I tend to take my sweet time, don't rush me.</p>
    <p>Often blunt and i don't care about a lot of things.<p>
    <p>Respect matters a lot to me, not just towards me but towards others as well.<p>
    <p>Often apprehensive with friendships.</p>
    <p>I am not afraid to tell you i don't like something.</p>
    <p>Generalised Anxiety Disorder.</p>
    <p>Tired all the time.</p>
    <p>Manic episodes can happen.</p>
    <p>Mood swings, this includes being snappy, i'm commonly frustrated/angry.</p>
    <p>Laughing is rare for me, don't mistake this as you being unfunny.</p>
    <p>Late to all trending media, and more forgetful of them than not since i'm not active on social media.</p>
