  <div align="center">
    <p>Hello, my name is Evaen (Ev for short) and i'm 18 years old, the birthday being on the 20th of November.</p>
    <p>A proud selfshipper of Twilight Sparkle with my fictional sonas; i'm aromantic and straight.<p>
    <p>I'm an ENFJ 1w2+2w3, in case a person like this doesn't suit your taste.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p>I am blind in my left eye and have Level Two Autism.</p>
    <p>Side note: hyperfixated on all shades of blue and is a big part of me. 💙</p>

  <div align="center">
    <p>I love cuddles, piles, do whatever you want even if I'm with people, shoutout to my cuddlers — just don't do anything that'll irritate me on purpose.</p>
    <p>I enjoy hangouts and crowds.<p>
    <p>Covering me is always fine by friends or if it's for cuddle purposes by strangers — otherwise, don't cover me for a long period of time.<p>
    <p>Whisper to interact, there's a small chance i might see your public message.</p>
    <p>I adore waking up to whispers, you are open to do so.</p>
    <p>Don't expect a response out of me all the time, but i will respond when i want to.<p>
    <p>Away From Keyboard/Off-tab a lot of the time, this doesn't mean always, as i could be talking to friends in party/whispers or making a skin — sleep emote doesn't always mean i'm busy.<p>
    <p>I'd appreciate if you don't ask to rolepay with me or even think i will.<p>
    <p>Don't always assume i'll give you attention for wearing a Belle skin, however all of them are great.<p>
    <p>I ignore all advertisements in my whispers, especially ones begging for assistance with their build limit, i'm not the guy for this.<p>
    <p>Copying me and/or my friends, with the knowledge of this action being strongly looked down upon without consent, is an awful action to do, refrain from doing this.</p>
